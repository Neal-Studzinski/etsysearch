Re-Create An Etsy Page - example: https://www.etsy.com/search?q=whiskey

Create your own API token by signing up as an Etsy developer

Create a function that makes an AJAX request to the Etsy API using whatever search term you'd like.
Create a data handler function to handle the data when it (asynchronously) returns from the API. Use this data to populate your webpage!

Recreate the Etsy search results page, styled as closely as possible to the actual Etsy site.
The most important thing is the actual search results. Do the rest of the page (including header and footer styles) after you have the search results rendering to the DOM

You should link the items to their proper Etsy product pages

You may omit the "Top Categories" section
No need to make any of the form elements work.
